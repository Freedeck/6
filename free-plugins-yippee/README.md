# free plugins yippee

These are not only demo plugins created with Freedeck Dev Environment meant to showcase how powerful plugins are, but also have a use!  

## LegacyImport (LI)

LegacyImport allows you to move your sound files over from your old Freedeck install into v6. It gives you instructions once you start Freedeck, having it in your `plugins` folder.

## ExamplePlugin

ExamplePlugin is solely just to demonstrate, to a very little extent, what you can do with plugins!
